Also, the management of the institution gives almost complete freedom to organize and decorate your event as you wish. Also, speaking of weddings, there is an opportunity to hold an outdoor ceremony on a small but cozy green lawn near the restaurant.
I would like to especially thank Oleh and Oleksandra for their help in choosing the menu and advice on preparing for the holiday.","–ù–µ—â–æ–¥–∞–≤–Ω–æ –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ–ª–∏ –≤ –¥–∞–Ω–æ–º—É —Ä–µ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∞–Ω—ñ –≤–µ—Å—ñ–ª–ª—è, –æ–±—Ä–∞–≤—à–∏ –±–µ–Ω–∫–µ—Ç-—Ö–æ–ª–ª –Ω–∞ 60 —á–æ–ª–æ–≤—ñ–∫. –ú–∏ –∑–∞–ª–∏—à–∏–ª–∏—Å—è —É –∑–∞—Ö–≤–∞—Ç—ñ, –∞–¥–∂–µ –æ–±—Ä–∞–Ω–µ –Ω–∞–º–∏ –º–µ–Ω—é –≤–∏—è–≤–∏–ª–æ—Å—è –¥—É–∂–µ —Å–º–∞—á–Ω–∏–º, –ø–æ–¥–∞—á–∞ –±—É–ª–∞ –Ω–∞ –≤–∏—Å–æ—Ç—ñ, –∞ –ø–µ—Ä—Å–æ–Ω–∞–ª –∑–∞–≤–∂–¥–∏ –±—É–≤ –≤—ñ–¥–∫—Ä–∏—Ç–∏–º –¥–æ —Å–ø—ñ–ª–∫—É–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—è —Ç–∞ –æ–±–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω—è –¥–µ—Ç–∞–ª–µ–π –∑–∞—Ö–æ–¥—É. –¢–∞–∫–æ–∂ –∫–µ—Ä—ñ–≤–Ω–∏—Ü—Ç–≤–æ –∑–∞–∫–ª–∞–¥—É –¥–∞—î –º–∞–π–∂–µ –ø–æ–≤–Ω—É —Å–≤–æ–±–æ–¥—É –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω—ñ–∑—É–≤–∞—Ç–∏ —Ç–∞ –ø—Ä–∏–∫—Ä–∞—Å–∏—Ç–∏ –≤–∞—à –∑–∞—Ö—ñ–¥ —Ç–∞–∫, —è–∫ –≤–∏ —Ç–æ–≥–æ —Ö–æ—á–µ—Ç–µ. –¢–∞–∫–æ–∂, –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä—è—á–∏ –ø—Ä–æ –≤–µ—Å—ñ–ª–ª—è, —Ç—É—Ç —î –º–æ–∂–ª–∏–≤—ñ—Å—Ç—å –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏ –≤–∏—ó–∑–Ω—É —Ü–µ—Ä–µ–º–æ–Ω—ñ—é –Ω–∞ –Ω–µ–≤–µ–ª–∏—á–∫—ñ–π, –∞–ª–µ –∑–∞—Ç–∏—à–Ω—ñ–π –∑–µ–ª–µ–Ω—ñ–π –≥–∞–ª—è–≤–∏–Ω—ñ –±—ñ–ª—è —Ä–µ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∞–Ω—É.
