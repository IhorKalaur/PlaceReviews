The service and staff are friendly and always happy to help and advise.

To dine in this place we were waiting outside for half hour to get sited. Initially we were taking to the room downstairs and were surprised as several tables were unoccupied. The question is: why they didn't invite us to sit sooner but left us waiting outside on the cold?
The basement hall had no internet connection and less nice than the main one, so we asked to be moved as some people left. That was ok. We were permitted to stay on the main room.
We ordered for 4 people. First arrived one dish for one of us, 30 minutes later arrived another one and 30 minutes after that arrived other two. They were simple dishes. Why should we have waited for an hour??? We probably were forgotten.
The 'pork meat Gutsul stile' was nice as well as 'oven baked vegetables with cheese' but the 'oven baked chicken potatoes under chees' was rubbish.
Overal experience: tried it once. It was okeish but wouldn't come back.
Service and food were very average as well as the price.","Lovely restaurant with lovely interior design and atmosphere. There was a live music as well which was a nice compliment.
To dine in this place we were waiting outside for half hour to get sited. Initially we were taking to the room downstairs and were surprised as several tables were unoccupied. The question is: why they didn't invite us to sit sooner but left us waiting outside on the cold?
The basement hall had no internet connection and less nice than the main one, so we asked to be moved as some people left. That was ok. We were permitted to stay on the main room.
We ordered for 4 people. First arrived one dish for one of us, 30 minutes later arrived another one and 30 minutes after that arrived other two. They were simple dishes. Why should we have waited for an hour??? We probably were forgotten.

Service is great though.

I wouldn't call this an authentic Korean BBQ place. Probably the best in terms of Asian cuisine places in Ukraine, but then again any ethnic food from Asia or any other continent other than Europe are quite lacking here, but still pretty low in terms of flavor and authenticity.

The babaganush is great, but it only comes in two tiny pies, so order more right away.
But the schnitzel, which this place is famous for, this time was completely disappointing, all the breading ""fell off"" from the meat, unfortunately I did not appreciate the potato salad, as it was dressed with a sauce with a noticeable amount of mustard and it interrupted the taste of the potatoes themselves.
Of course, sweets from the Candy Store are always good.
The waiters are very well trained, they know what to advise, but probably due to the fact that now during the renovation the Sugar Shop and the Restaurant are united in one room and there are more visitors from above, they are very busy, they have to wait a long time for a table, you have to wave your hand to attract attention, that's why this is also the nuance of the service, which I hope is temporary.

They were absolutely tasteless, and besides, they were deep-fried and not in a frying pan, as is customary in our country.

We tried the roast beef with green butter, it was really cool! But the minus is 3 croutons to it, for such a portion you need to add at least one more.
Pumpkin soup was also delicious, thick, with nuts and bacon.

I don't feel like going to a restaurant at all, it's a cafe, going once is already too much... Food +-, although I liked only one of the 3 dishes - khachapuri, the meat is very mediocre. But the atmosphere is the bottom. The tables are placed in such a way that it is simply impossible to reach some, and on others people sit almost on top of each other and disturb the staff. When this was pointed out to the manager of the ""restaurant"", she did not even admit that there were problems and did not try to improve the impression of the establishment and only offered to move now. This despite the fact that they booked a table more than a week in advance, and gave the worst option even though there were others free! The music is playing very loudly and three times we asked to make it quieter, because we couldn't hear each other, it only helped for a while, because it was the manager who came and made it louder.

The idea is interesting, there is no concept. It is not clear where the entrance to the institution is, it seems like they wanted to make a riddle, but it turned out as if you ask us and we will tell you where the entrance is. The taste is not tasty at all, sweet, dry. This is an ordinary sponge cake and not Belgian chocolate at all. I am a confectioner and I can definitely tell where the chocolate is. This impression is as if ordinary chocolate ""crown"" or roshen was melted. I am generally silent about the chocolate in the middle, as if it were a simple chocolate filling from the supermarket. The choice of drinks is minimal. They offered to add chocolate in the middle of the bar, but they did not say that there would be an additional fee for this.
Drinks are generally a problem. Three types of juice, two types of teas, and those from a bag, not brewed. I can't say about coffee and alcoholic drinks because I don't drink them. The staff is not competent in what they offer, they cannot explain what the tea they offer tastes like.

I fully understand that it is a weekend, and the number of guests may be higher, so why not put more staff on shift?
We ordered 3 beers, 2 pizzas and 1 portion of antipasti.
In a few minutes they brought beer, after 15 minutes pizza, after another 5 we were served a table, but the antipasti was never brought, although we were counting on it before the pizza.
After some time, the administrator came to clear the table, we clarified how long we would have to wait for the antipasti, what was the answer, whether we had ordered it at all and how long ago.
It was clear that the waitress had simply forgotten to punch in our order completely.
Having spent another good 10 minutes waiting, I had to refuse the meal, because the cut, which is prepared at 100% occupancy of the establishment, takes up to 15 minutes, but no more.","–î—É–∂–µ —à–∫–æ–¥–∞, —â–æ —Ç–∞–∫–∏–π –Ω–∏–∑—å–∫–∏–π —Ä—ñ–≤–µ–Ω—å –æ–±—Å–ª—É–≥–æ–≤—É–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—è.

But we are stubborn people, so after looking around we still found him. We recommend that owners install additional billboards or adjust location information. Everything about the interior is very decent: nice, clean, design in modern motifs. The waiter is polite, took the order quickly, navigated the menu, served the dishes on time. I can't say that the menu is big, there aren't many dishes. We chose broth for the first course, and pork steak with potatoes and veal medallions with mushroom sauce for the second course. Everything was tasty, the meat was cooked well, the design of the dish could have looked more restaurant-like, but it did not affect the taste in any way.

We lived in the complex where the institution is located, so we went there many times. Both for breakfast and dinner, in addition, the establishment serves by the pool when it's warm. I don't like oysters (a feature of the establishment), so I didn't taste them, but my friend said they were very fresh and tasty.

I witnessed how the waiter or the cook poured the dishes into those large containers, which were on the counter and at the foot of the table, where the salad was spilled, and then also the potatoes. I made a remark that all the food was lying on the tables, and the waiter picked it all up with his hand and threw it to the rest of the food! That is, in front of my eyes, he picked up the food that fell on the dirty table at his feet and threw it into the container from where customers collect their meals! It's just horrible. If they allow themselves to do this in front of a client, then it means that it is the norm for them, and in the kitchen, probably even more trash is made!

We chose a table by the window with access to the courtyard, made an order, had a pleasant conversation with the waiter, and were impressed by the interior. It was quite cold in the hall, the air conditioner was working for heating, but probably not strong enough. We were brought drinks, no complaints, because we were informed about the composition, so ok, we chose ourselves, maybe just not for us (warm cocktail with sea buckthorn).
We ordered two salads, one with spicy and sweet chicken, the other Caesar with chicken, and were indignant because they turned out to be not tasty. That in one, that in the other, the chicken was stewed and very not tasty. In the first, the sauce was just the chicken in the sauce, in the second, everything was covered with sauce too much, which completely spoiled the taste. We left the salads, informed the waiter about it, he said that he would pass it on to the kitchen and come to us. We waited a very long time for an answer and did not wait, asked for the bill, during the payment the waiter told us that the chef said that everyone has their own tastes. On the unpleasant side, there was also the fact that next to our table there was a door where the guests of the establishment and the staff could go out for a smoke break, we could have warned, because it was already cold. The bartender, who was wearing a hood all the time and after a smoke break, started preparing drinks without washing his hands. They were not satisfied as much as possible, there is no desire to come again.
