2 stars for the kitchen. Honestly it was a disappointment. The separation of the kabukis is noticeable where the kitchen part left off.
I don't understand the spicy point and I love fusion cuisine, but in this case I think you either do Mexican or you do Japanese. The coexistence of both in the kitchen is not trivial.
It may be that we were also unlucky and found ourselves already biased by this fact. The raw clams (later they offered us to change it, I tell you, no problem with the room). The suckling pig roll looked like one of those ordinary sushi bars. He didn't tell us anything. Then some bull, squid and shrimp niguiris that didn't tell us much, very simple. Some scallops with a background that stung the De Dios. Anyway, a bit of a disaster.","Sinceramente el personal de la sala es incre√≠ble. Nos trataron genial y muy atentos a nuestras cr√≠ticas constructivas.
2 estrellas a la cocina. Sinceramente fue una decepci√≥n. La separaci√≥n de los kabukis se nota donde qued√≥ la parte de la cocina.
El punto picante no lo llego a entender y me encanta la cocina fusi√≥n, pero en este caso creo q o haces mexicano o haces japo. La convivencia de ambos en la cocina no es trivial.
Puede ser que tambi√©n tuvimos mala suerte y nos encontramos ya sesgados por este hecho. Las almejas crudas (luego nos ofrecieron cambiarlo, ya os digo, ning√∫n problema con la sala). El rollito de cochinita, parec√≠a de esos sushi-bar cualquiera. No nos dijo nada. Luego unos niguiris de toro, calamar y gamba que no nos dijeron mucho, muy simples. Unas vieras con un fondo que picaba la De Dios.

Kabuki Madrid,places/ChIJI1Sg0IkpQg0RpmEXngDUrh8/reviews/ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM1OHYyblh3EAE,5 months ago,5,"Those who know all the Kabuki that have opened in the Spanish geography will recognize in this Kabuki the essence of the brand both culinary wise, there are many of the dishes created by its chefs throughout history - you can see the work of Alejandro Dur√°n, but the hand of some of the hidden stars of the brand in recent years such as David Rivero, Victor Serrano or Rafa Carrasco appears; As aesthetically, I always thought that the interior designer has been influenced by the shadow of Tanizaki, although I have to admit that in this place he has surpassed himself, because he has managed to balance it with personalized lighting and sound that take it to another level: that detail is nothing It's trivial to have your own light on each table and music accompanying you, but not spoiling the food, it's the best.

On this first visit I choose the Ankawa Nigiri and the Kabuki Brioche dessert. The first is brutal, this new version is a turbot delicacy that I already knew the Japanese love, but, eating it here, you realize why. And the second, because traditionally desserts have not been the brand's main dish, but with this Brioche with artisan yuzu ice cream, more than one will go just to eat it.

In addition to the restaurant, it has a bar that can mark a before and after in such a commercial area. Being able to go and have a snack -without entering the restaurant-, almost at any time from 1:30 p.m., is wonderful. A short food menu, but ideal to accompany a drink and continue on the path or have an after-dinner meal, now that so many restaurants do not allow it. The whiskey menu in this bar is impressive, you don't usually see things like this in the Forum, a divine selection of Japanese whiskeys and a Macallan vertical that only lovers of these spirits will be able to appreciate in their proper measure. For my part, I'll stick with DF C√≥ctel, a signature version of Tom Collins, because those of us who knew the now defunct Sudestada, know that it is a full-fledged tribute to the brand and the level it set.","Aquellos que conocen todos los Kabuki que han abierto en la geograf√≠a espa√±ola, reconocer√°n en este Kabuki la esencia de la marca tanto culinariamente, hay muchos de los platos creados por sus cocineros a lo largo de historia -se ve el trabajo de Alejandro Dur√°n, pero aparece la mano de algunos de los cracks ocultos de la marca de los √∫ltimos a√±os como David Rivero, Victor Serrano o Rafa Carrasco-; como est√©ticamente, siempre pens√© que dise√±ador de interiores ha estado influido por la sombra de Tanizaki, aunque tengo reconocer que en este local se ha superado, porque ha conseguido equilibrarlo con una iluminaci√≥n y un sonido personalizados que lo llevan a otro nivel: ese detalle nada balad√≠ de tener luz propia en cada mesa y la m√∫sica acompa√±√°ndote, pero no fastidiando la comida, es lo m√°s.

Me quedo en esta primera visita con el Nigiri de Ankawa y el postre de Kabuki Brioche. El primero es brutal, esta nueva versi√≥n es una delicatessen de rodaballo que ya sab√≠a que los japoneses adoran, pero, al comerlo aqu√≠, uno se da cuenta de por qu√©. Y el segundo, porque tradicionalmente los postres no han sido el plato fuerte de la marca, pero con este Brioche con helado artesano de yuzu, m√°s de uno ir√° s√≥lo a comerlo.

Adem√°s del restaurante, tiene un bar que puede marcar un antes y un despu√©s en una zona tan comercial. Eso de poder ir, tomar un picoteo -sin entrar en el restaurante-, casi a cualquier hora desde la 13.30, es maravilloso. Una carta de comida corta, pero ideal acompa√±ar una copa y seguir el camino o hacer la sobremesa, ahora que tantos restaurantes no lo permiten. Impresiona de este bar la carta de whiskys, no se suelen ver cosas as√≠ en el Foro, una selecci√≥n divina de whiskys japoneses y una vertical de Macallan que solo los amantes de estos destilados podr√°n apreciar en su justa de medida. Yo por mi parte me quedo con DF C√≥ctel, una versi√≥n de autor del Tom Collins, porque aquellos que conocimos los del ya desaparecido Sudestada, sabemos que es un homenaje en toda regla a la marca y al nivel que marc√≥.",Alejandra Ya√±ez,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104003888544448367781/reviews,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUFhQzKmkGctRLmobnCyrqDWfY6M-nU0zwfGTjWrRyffZeJqLGn=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3,2023-10-12T12:02:43Z

To dine in this place we were waiting outside for half hour to get sited. Initially we were taking to the room downstairs and were surprised as several tables were unoccupied. The question is: why they didn't invite us to sit sooner but left us waiting outside on the cold?
The basement hall had no internet connection and less nice than the main one, so we asked to be moved as some people left. That was ok. We were permitted to stay on the main room.
We ordered for 4 people. First arrived one dish for one of us, 30 minutes later arrived another one and 30 minutes after that arrived other two. They were simple dishes. Why should we have waited for an hour??? We probably were forgotten.
The 'pork meat Gutsul stile' was nice as well as 'oven baked vegetables with cheese' but the 'oven baked chicken potatoes under chees' was rubbish.

Therefore, after reading the reviews about this one, I decided to check how bad everything was, that the opera house could not correct the situation. And from the first minutes inside, I realized that it seemed like I was reading comments for another coffee shop...
Let's start with the main, first impression, and it really affects a person, it especially affected me: a relaxed atmosphere, light notes of coffee in the air and a beautiful view outside the window - what else is needed for a pleasantly spent evening?
Okay, maybe the bad attitude from the staff is spoiling everything here? Surprisingly, no, I was immediately approached by a cute waitress (it's a shame I didn't ask her name), who helped me choose a delicious dessert, the conversation was relaxed and pleasant.
As for the kitchen, I didn't order anything like that, but they know how to make a flat white, special thanks for it. I can't really say anything about the croissant with grouper and caramel, it was tasty and tasty.
So, I liked the institution, maybe soon it will become my favorite, we will see with time.","–Ø –ª—é–±–ª—é —Ä—ñ–∑–Ω—ñ –∞—Ç–º–æ—Å—Ñ–µ—Ä–Ω—ñ –∑–∞–∫–ª–∞–¥–∏, –æ—Å–æ–±–ª–∏–≤–æ —Ç—ñ, –≤ —è–∫–∏–π —î —á–∏–º –∑–∞–π–Ω—è—Ç–∏—Å—è, –ø–æ–∫–∏ —á–µ–∫–∞—î—à –Ω–∞ –∑–∞–º–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—è. –¢–æ–º—É –Ω–∞—á–∏—Ç–∞–≤—à–∏—Å—å –≤—ñ–¥–≥—É–∫—ñ–≤ –ø—Ä–æ –ø—Ä–æ —Ü—é –≤–∏—Ä—ñ—à–∏–≤ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–≤—ñ—Ä–∏—Ç–∏ –Ω–∞—Å–∫—ñ–ª—å–∫–∏ –≤—Å–µ –ø–æ–≥–∞–Ω–æ, —â–æ –∞–∂ –æ–ø–µ—Ä–Ω–∏–π —Ç–µ–∞—Ç—Ä –Ω–µ –∑–º—ñ–≥ –≤–∏–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç–∏ —Å–∏—Ç—É–∞—Ü—ñ—é. –Ü –∑ –ø–µ—Ä—à–∏—Ö —Ö–≤–∏–ª–∏–Ω –≤—Å–µ—Ä–µ–¥–∏–Ω—ñ, —è –∑—Ä–æ–∑—É–º—ñ–≤, —â–æ, —Å—Ö–æ–∂–µ, —á–∏—Ç–∞–≤ –∫–æ–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞—Ä—ñ –¥–æ —ñ–Ω—à–æ—ó –∫–∞–≤'—è—Ä–Ω—ñ...

But the service is such that you can hug and cry. The guy who played the role of the bartender talked as if we broke into his house without an invitation. After our order, he actually sat down to eat and started watching a video on his phone with the sound on the entire establishment. And what kind of manner is it to answer calls while turning on the loudspeaker?! As the person who was in the establishment with me said, it gives the impression that the bartender has been working for the last day and he imposed all the rules from a high mountain. Owners of the institution pay attention! Because of such employees, your business multiplies by 0. And one more note, the hall is full of urine when visitors to the establishment open the door to the restroom.
So the conclusions are as follows: if the kitchen is a priority for people and there is a stuffy nose and indifference to communication on the part of the employees of the establishment with the client, then I sincerely recommend it.

Service is great though.

I wouldn't call this an authentic Korean BBQ place. Probably the best in terms of Asian cuisine places in Ukraine, but then again any ethnic food from Asia or any other continent other than Europe are quite lacking here, but still pretty low in terms of flavor and authenticity.

The babaganush is great, but it only comes in two tiny pies, so order more right away.
But the schnitzel, which this place is famous for, this time was completely disappointing, all the breading ""fell off"" from the meat, unfortunately I did not appreciate the potato salad, as it was dressed with a sauce with a noticeable amount of mustard and it interrupted the taste of the potatoes themselves.
Of course, sweets from the Candy Store are always good.
The waiters are very well trained, they know what to advise, but probably due to the fact that now during the renovation the Sugar Shop and the Restaurant are united in one room and there are more visitors from above, they are very busy, they have to wait a long time for a table, you have to wave your hand to attract attention, that's why this is also the nuance of the service, which I hope is temporary.

They were absolutely tasteless, and besides, they were deep-fried and not in a frying pan, as is customary in our country.

In general, everything began to limp since the scaling of the network, because in the first two years of operation of the establishment near Technopark - I did not have any comments. All items on the menu were very tasty and interesting, and the service was the best (no exaggeration).
But that's another story... and now about the facility in Viking:
‚Ä¢ the waiters do not pay attention to you until the last moment (guests at the next table also complained about this)
‚Ä¢ the quality of the prepared dishes here is worse (the pizza was burnt, and taking into account the large edges of the dough itself, 40% of the pizza had to be left); there is enough filling in the melta so that you don't overeat sometimes, but the bread is enough, of courseüôÉ there used to be a delicious melta with kimchi and with normal chicken, not ""kebab"" (this kebab is a separate topic altogether, because the impression is that these are the worst scraps chicken thighs, with a large amount of not very edible elements)
‚Ä¢ and the highlight of this location is an open kitchen) where the team of cooks always clashes (using profanity); I'm not very happy to eat in the epicenter of kitchen messes, I'm sorryüôà
* the lamps on the tables never light up, because no one charges them (
I am very sorry that such a once beautiful institution is falling into the abyss of an expensive canteen :(

I usually do not write reviews after a one-time or first visit in order to fully understand the quality level of the institution.
So: pleasant service, even before ordering we were given a glass of water, which in principle is a small thing, but nice and actually very correct.
Besides, few people do that!

Regarding the order, I read previous reviews that the pizza was dry and the filling was not of good quality or tasty. In my case, this did not happen, on the contrary, the dough was very tasty, as well as the filling, there was enough of everything, which in principle you can see in the photo!)
Separately, I want to note their sauces for sides, it‚Äôs like mast-hev for me) I came at 1708, took a pizza, so there must be a sauce for sides, you can‚Äôt refuse this, especially basil üåø

In the photo, it may seem that we did not add basil a little, but no, I ate it, because it was already very fragrant!üòÑ","–î–≤—ñ—á—ñ –≤—ñ–¥–≤—ñ–¥—É–≤–∞–≤ —Ü–µ–π –∑–∞–∫–ª–∞–¥ —ñ –¥–≤—ñ—á—ñ –º–µ–Ω—ñ —É –≤–∞—Å —Å–ø–æ–¥–æ–±–∞–ª–æ—Å—å.

I am not coming here for the first time, because there are not many establishments on Pasichnaya, so this is a great comfort for the whole district.
A simple cafe, without tricks, where, however, everything is very tasty.
I liked that the waitress advised what was better to try and could tell which of the dishes had the best taste.
We tried the roast beef with green butter, it was really cool! But the minus is 3 croutons to it, for such a portion you need to add at least one more.
Pumpkin soup was also delicious, thick, with nuts and bacon.

I also recommend French Kiss cake that comes in the small or large version! I picked up an order of the French Kiss cake for my mum's birthday today and I'm absolutely thrilled with the professional service, craftsmanship, and the taste palette of this cake. If you want a light and fruity treat, French Kiss is literally ""chef's kiss""! Thank you to the top manager for organising a swift delivery and for catering to my needsüôè üôå I really appreciate your help.

I don't feel like going to a restaurant at all, it's a cafe, going once is already too much... Food +-, although I liked only one of the 3 dishes - khachapuri, the meat is very mediocre. But the atmosphere is the bottom. The tables are placed in such a way that it is simply impossible to reach some, and on others people sit almost on top of each other and disturb the staff. When this was pointed out to the manager of the ""restaurant"", she did not even admit that there were problems and did not try to improve the impression of the establishment and only offered to move now.

The waiter did not bother me, as is sometimes customary. I liked it all very much. I‚Äôm really looking forward to the summer so I can go to this cafe again and enjoy the moment.

Why is the weight of each portion indicated in the menu? Is it possible that you do not pay attention to the quantity and weight when you order a product?

Trout on the vegetables was delicious but served just 5 minutes after the soup, so I was still eating soup while trout was getting colder every minute.
Have the staff had basic understanding or training? Or just I strutted to serve ASAP. (BTW. when I was at the restaurant it was almost empty...)
As I said, trout was really good, but soup - nope. It was flat, battery, even after adding ful bowl of condiment it was served with.
Local is focused on selling mead related products, including alcohols.
But ordering food is a 50/50 chance...

Today, unfortunately, this did not happen - we waited for food for about 30-40 minutes, under the condition that the seating was not complete, they brought khinkali, later khachapuri, the cheese in them was absolutely not salty, and the overall impression of the dishes was not the best :( objectively, the food was not tasty, quite a long wait, considering that I always take khachapuri here and know its classic taste here)
I liked only the chicken shish kebab, but after half an hour of waiting and a not cheap check, it was a real disappointment. The waiter's reaction to this remark was somewhat sarcastic, and nothing was offered in return, in general 5 stars for the atmosphere and ""branded"" greeting from the staff, and gratitude to the girl who met and led to the table.

I don't feel like going to a restaurant at all, it's a cafe, going once is already too much... Food +-, although I liked only one of the 3 dishes - khachapuri, the meat is very mediocre. But the atmosphere is the bottom. The tables are placed in such a way that it is simply impossible to reach some, and on others people sit almost on top of each other and disturb the staff. When this was pointed out to the manager of the ""restaurant"", she did not even admit that there were problems and did not try to improve the impression of the establishment and only offered to move now.

They were absolutely tasteless, and besides, they were deep-fried and not in a frying pan, as is customary in our country. Therefore, they had a lot of excess fat, and the breading was soggy; they were not crunchy at all.

Although the hood is present, it is either not turned on or does not work, which makes all the clothes very quickly start to smell like kebab.

In addition to the kebabs, nuggets and fries, you can order draft beer, which is a great idea.

The recipes are a little strange, such as a mix of fresh and pickled cucumber in a classic kebab, or Mexican, where there is a lot of fresh bell pepper, but it is delicious.
The meat is only chicken, but this is completely enough.","–ü–µ—Ä—à–µ —â–æ –∑—É—Å—Ç—Ä—ñ—á–∞—î, –ø—ñ—Å–ª—è –¥—É–∂–µ –∫–æ—Ä–æ—Ç–∫–æ—ó –¥–≤–µ—Ä–Ω–æ—ó —Ä—É—á–∫–∏, —Ü–µ –∑–∞–ø–∞—Ö –∫—É—Ö–Ω—ñ —É –ø—Ä–∏–º—ñ—â–µ–Ω–Ω—ñ. –í–∏—Ç—è–∂–∫–∞ —Ö–æ—á —ñ –ø—Ä–∏—Å—É—Ç–Ω—è, –∞–ª–µ –∞–±–æ –Ω–µ –≤–∫–ª—é—á–µ–Ω–∞, –∞–±–æ –Ω–µ –ø—Ä–∞—Ü—é—î, –≤—ñ–¥ —á–æ–≥–æ –≤–µ—Å—å –æ–¥—è–≥ –¥—É–∂–µ —à–≤–∏–¥–∫–æ –ø–æ—á–∏–Ω–∞—î –ø–∞—Ö–Ω—É—Ç–∏ –∫–µ–±–∞–±–æ–º.

We tried their top dishes (because it's cool that they have the opportunity to like the dishes).
Before our dishes were served, we were complimented with fresh pita with olive oil and spices.

‚û∞Adjarian-style khachapuri, with professional mixing of cheese and egg, by a waiter at the table. And it's really very tasty.
‚ûøKhinkali with mushrooms and creamy sauce is something worth coming back for again and again. The dough is thin and cooked perfectly.
„Ä∞Ô∏èThe salad with walnut sauce was a perfect addition to the dough dishes.

A glass of dry wine, a great atmosphere and friendly staff were the perfect ending to a great impression of this establishment.

Tried two pastries ""ham with cheese"" and ""cherry with chocolate"". In short - the taste cannot be compared with anything (burgers, hotdogs, cheeseburgers from McDonald's compared to this - nothing for me!). When I bought it, I was tuned in to the taste of a cheap and simple ""bun"", but with the first piece in my mouth, the impression changed, it was not clear how the pastry could at the same time taste like ordinary bread, but bread without excessive pseudo flavors! I am impressed. Once again, I am convinced of the truth that what is tastier is what is simple and high-quality without artificial flavor additives.
I recommend you try it! I'm not trying to convince you to forget about McDonald's, try the ""Georgian bread"" and you will understand what provoked me to write this here. Thanks to the ""Georgian Bread"" team! I would like to add, it is a pity that your coverage in Lviv is still very small. Your nearest bakery is 1 kilometer away from my house.

Of course, prices are rising like everywhere else, but this is understandable: the cost of the original products is also not cheap.

However, I sincerely recommend it, responsive and friendly saleswomen, diligent bakers.","–ö–∞–∫ –∂–µ —è –ª—é–±–ª—é –ø—Ä–æ–¥—É–∫—Ü–∏—é —ç—Ç–æ–π —Å–µ—Ç–∏! –û–¥–Ω–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è –æ–Ω–∏ –±—ã–ª–∏ –∑–∞–∫—Ä—ã—Ç—ã, —è —É–∂–µ –∏—Å–ø—É–≥–∞–ª–∞—Å—å, —á—Ç–æ –Ω–∞–≤—Å–µ–≥–¥–∞. –ù–æ —ç—Ç–æ –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ –±—ã–ª–∞ —Ä–µ–∫–æ–Ω—Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ü–∏—è –∏–ª–∏ —Ä–∞—Å—à–∏—Ä–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ø–æ–º–µ—â–µ–Ω–∏–π.

The idea is interesting, there is no concept. It is not clear where the entrance to the institution is, it seems like they wanted to make a riddle, but it turned out as if you ask us and we will tell you where the entrance is. The taste is not tasty at all, sweet, dry. This is an ordinary sponge cake and not Belgian chocolate at all. I am a confectioner and I can definitely tell where the chocolate is. This impression is as if ordinary chocolate ""crown"" or roshen was melted. I am generally silent about the chocolate in the middle, as if it were a simple chocolate filling from the supermarket. The choice of drinks is minimal. They offered to add chocolate in the middle of the bar, but they did not say that there would be an additional fee for this.
Drinks are generally a problem. Three types of juice, two types of teas, and those from a bag, not brewed. I can't say about coffee and alcoholic drinks because I don't drink them. The staff is not competent in what they offer, they cannot explain what the tea they offer tastes like.

I can't understand how this place has 4 stars but I was disappointed on almost every aspect of our stay, which we cut short due to the horrible treatment we received. I will list a few to warn other travelers so they don't make the same mistake we did in booking this location:
1) The AC didn't work at all the first night and the manager cussed us out when we insisted it be turned on the second night (it was switched off which I can't understand- it's August for crying out loud and very hot outside!).
2) The price includes breakfast. The meal was poor, with little variety and despite only 3 families present to eat, the cereals were low or empty, no bowls for the cereal so we used a coffee cup, jelly jar was empty, and no fruit or vegetables available, the eggs burned and a few hotdogs instead of sausage or bacon given for protein. And when asked for the items to be refilled or a substitute given, our requests were dismissed or completely ignored.
3) The listing claims to have a pool which is one of the reasons we choose this location. We could not swim however due to the lack of treatment of the water (yucky green and murky) and the cold temperature despite the hot weather outside.
4) The room stank terribly of bleach and detergent upon our arrival- so much so we had to air out the suite for several hours before we could become comfortable.
5) Halls and stairwell were dark and when we'd turn the light on to walk downstairs, the manager would come behind us and turn them off. Also turned the light off on us both times we ate in the dining room. Very rude.
The list continues and we've filed our complaint but I hope everyone is warned. We found a different hotel and there enjoyed the rest of our vacation.

Hotel is very conveniently located, just 3mins.walk to the electric railway station ""Sibir"" and has enough parking spaces even when the place is busy. As we were staying longer than 2nights, we got a Tatry Card which entitled us to many discounts (cable car fares, food, drinks...) and unlimited free travel on the local electric railway system. Those trains(trams) were getting us daily to the local places of interest (mountains) so, two of us saved a great deal of EURos there.

There was a wedding party on our arrival so, we got conveniently offered a room on the 3rd (top) floor with lift(elevator) so, were not disturbed by any of the party noise. Our room 305 was clean and tidy with beautiful mountain views. There were a few scars on the walls and the towel hook was broken but I do not see this as a big deal. Everything else was working and well taken care of.

The service was outstanding, all the staff were very friendly, cheerful and always happy to help. We think they have done a great deal of work to make our stay pleasant and enjoyable. All of them including the kitchen staff deserve big thanks. Especially helpful was Patrik, one of the reception staff. Once a day, we could use the finish sauna and jacuzzi as a part of our package which was great after some long mountain walks. We stayed in the sauna a bit longer in the evenings but the staff did not mind. We think that the jacuzzi room would do with some door as it feels kind of strange when someone is playing a table tennis behind the shower curtain whilst we were having a relaxing bath. :)

We had tasteful breakfasts and dinners every day. Breakfasts were in the form of a buffet, all fresh and enough to keep us going until afternoon. All 3 dinners including the soups were delicious and freshly made. The desserts were a little bit weaker than the whole menu but still good.

The internet access is WiFi only and you have to be close to the reception/restaurant to get a free access. We did not come to surf the internet all day so, it was fine to sit downstairs at the bar. Just an hour before our departure, we experienced a short drop in the water pressure but I believe this might have been due to the high local water demand (often seen in remote mountain resorts).

We would definitely come again and recommend this place to people coming to make the most of the Tatry mountains for an affordable price a spend the evenings in a friendly hotel.

I fully understand that it is a weekend, and the number of guests may be higher, so why not put more staff on shift?
We ordered 3 beers, 2 pizzas and 1 portion of antipasti.
In a few minutes they brought beer, after 15 minutes pizza, after another 5 we were served a table, but the antipasti was never brought, although we were counting on it before the pizza.
After some time, the administrator came to clear the table, we clarified how long we would have to wait for the antipasti, what was the answer, whether we had ordered it at all and how long ago.
It was clear that the waitress had simply forgotten to punch in our order completely.
Having spent another good 10 minutes waiting, I had to refuse the meal, because the cut, which is prepared at 100% occupancy of the establishment, takes up to 15 minutes, but no more.","–î—É–∂–µ —à–∫–æ–¥–∞, —â–æ —Ç–∞–∫–∏–π –Ω–∏–∑—å–∫–∏–π —Ä—ñ–≤–µ–Ω—å –æ–±—Å–ª—É–≥–æ–≤—É–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—è.

But we are stubborn people, so after looking around we still found him. We recommend that owners install additional billboards or adjust location information. Everything about the interior is very decent: nice, clean, design in modern motifs. The waiter is polite, took the order quickly, navigated the menu, served the dishes on time. I can't say that the menu is big, there aren't many dishes. We chose broth for the first course, and pork steak with potatoes and veal medallions with mushroom sauce for the second course. Everything was tasty, the meat was cooked well, the design of the dish could have looked more restaurant-like, but it did not affect the taste in any way.

But we were in the summer when the institution was just starting its work. The staff is not yet permanent, the menu is being tested.
But I will 100% come back if I'm there again. The atmosphere is very cozy. Owners and managers try to take feedback, what is liked, what is not. Most dishes are very tasty.
We lived in the complex where the institution is located, so we went there many times. Both for breakfast and dinner, in addition, the establishment serves by the pool when it's warm. I don't like oysters (a feature of the establishment), so I didn't taste them, but my friend said they were very fresh and tasty.

I took a self-pickup from the institution, quite a profitable offer.

Without a doubt, I will say that it is delicious here. I am more than satisfied with the order and this time I did not regret that I ordered from a new establishment.

For this price segment, these rolls have enough filling. I thought one roll was slightly salty, but in general the rolls are tasty, although some do not have a strong taste. The set also included 5 types of gunkan and 3 types of nigiri. Since I never bought them, this was one of the reasons why I decided to take this set. Gunkans are somewhat neutral to me, but nigiri are very tasty.

There are no complaints about the service. The wait was said to be up to 80 minutes, I arrived ~ 65 minutes later and the order was already waiting for me.

I generally liked both sets, but Hit Price Friday more, because I liked the roles from there more. There is enough filling in the rolls, even a lot of fish. I liked the omelette rolls and the avocado roll. The sauce and wasabi/ginger were generously given, even though they knew it was enough for two people.

Received the order in 67 minutes (promised between 60-90 minutes).

This is the third attempt to order rollers here, the first two asked to pay extra for delivery, although the website promises free delivery for my location for orders over 500. After the third attempt, I was satisfied. Maybe I would still advise when the operator calls to clarify how much sauce/wasabi/ginger is provided for free and whether I need that much, I would take less than they give, because I won't use it all anyway.","–ó–∞–º–æ–≤–ª—è–ª–∏ –Ω–∞ –æ–±—ñ–¥ –¥–ª—è –¥–≤–æ—Ö –ª—é–¥–µ–π: —Å–µ—Ç Fish Time —Ç–∞ —Å–µ—Ç –•—ñ—Ç –¶—ñ–Ω–∞ –ü'—è—Ç–Ω–∏—Ü—è.

Buy better for this money kebabs, chebureks or a small sushi set from the establishment (it starts with O, ends with A), you will get much more pleasure. Of course, I did not expect that it would be tasty, considering the price of UAH 560 (with packaging, which is separately added to the cost of the order and delivery). You just get rice, lots of rice, lots of rice and almost no toppings. The only thing that was more or less interesting in taste was the ""Krabik Hot roll"". And the appearance, the photos on the website are very well done, in fact you get ""well, that's it"".

Sushi Story,places/ChIJpeWTycTdOkcRfwO3GOHHBNI/reviews/ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkeDkzSTJBRRAB,a month ago,1,"Reviews with 5 stars - bought!!!!!
the staff themselves say about it and do not hide it.
There are so many people who are not satisfied with the service, taste, appearance, packaging, delivery that it is not difficult to guess for yourself that there cannot be true good reviews here.
They are not at all competent in this matter, even the photos that people attach here prove it. This packaging is terrible and expensive!! And it's like when you have fun in a restaurant and pack everything into containers to take home! Tap-lap and give money. And there are a lot of negative reviews!! And ours to correct, to change something? Why? If you can buy reviews and continue to be on the market. They can't even stand next to a food establishment, let alone a sushi business!!
Do not order anything there! And don't give it to children. Salmonellosis or bacillus is definitely possible here. Because this is an establishment that does not care about its reputation, the method of changes, improvements, improvements, or the elementary trained sushi chef. After reading reviews from a century ago, you understand that nothing has changed here. There is no taste. The rice is terrible. And a lot of it. You can't even taste the fish. Not professionally cut. Horribly composed. Warm rolls are not in a special, heat-saving box. And in an ordinary cardboard one. And for such packaging, you have to pay extra to the amount of the set. They will give you a ball. One wasabi and one portion of ginger for more than a kilogram set of rice, which falls apart and tastes like rubber.
I just have to leave this review!!!!! Read before you buy, not like me!
Spent money. Because it is impossible to eat!!!","–í—ñ–¥–≥—É–∫–∏ –∑ 5 –∑—ñ—Ä–∫–∞–º–∏ - –∫—É–ø–ª–µ–Ω—ñ!!!!!

I agree with the previous reviews, the rolls are quite small, the fillings are really small, the roll with tartar (it was a gift for the first order) is strange and not tasty.

Sushi Point,places/ChIJiftvbAnnOkcRWH8IlkkBRt4/reviews/ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURGNnRILWNBEAE,5 months ago,1,"I have never been so disappointed with a home delivery order as I was today. I decided to try sushi from this restaurant because I saw a lot of good reviews.

The amount of filling in the sushi was insufficient. Compared to sushi at other restaurants, the sushi was pretty empty.

As for the fish, the expression ""not fresh"" accurately reflects my impression. The dried fish had a strange taste and smell that indicated that it might be stale or even unfit for consumption.

Finally, the taste of the rice was too sweet. It was a bit strange and not to my liking. I always think of rice as the main ingredient in sushi, and the excessive sweetness of the rice really affected the overall taste of the dish in a negative way.

Under these circumstances, perhaps the best recommendation would be to avoid this restaurant, at least for home delivery, and look for other establishments where the quality and taste of the sushi will meet your expectations","–ú–µ–Ω—ñ —â–µ –Ω—ñ–∫–æ–ª–∏ –Ω–µ –¥–æ–≤–æ–¥–∏–ª–æ—Å—è –±—É—Ç–∏ —Ç–∞–∫–æ—é —Ä–æ–∑—á–∞—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–æ—é –∑–∞–º–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—è–º –∑ –¥–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–æ—é –¥–æ–¥–æ–º—É, —è–∫ —Å—å–æ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—ñ. –Ø –≤–∏—Ä—ñ—à–∏–ª–∞ —Å–ø—Ä–æ–±—É–≤–∞—Ç–∏ —Å—É—à—ñ –∑ —Ü—å–æ–≥–æ —Ä–µ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∞–Ω–∞, –æ—Å–∫—ñ–ª—å–∫–∏ –±–∞—á–∏–ª–∞ –±–∞–≥–∞—Ç–æ —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–∏—Ö –≤—ñ–¥–≥—É–∫—ñ–≤.

Unfortunately, I was not satisfied. I believe that the price does not correspond to the offer. In some places, there is very little filling, it can be seen in the photo, but after the ""front"" roles, there was a worse situation here and there. I was interested in the taste of hot unagi, but it also lacked something. For the same price, I ate tastier and better quality sets in other establishments, so I regretted ordering from a new place. Soy sauce was not enough, it was not enough for the whole set.

What can I say about this packaging, it's not bad, I liked it.

Unfortunately, the dishes are not at all similar to the photos they have on the website. Ordered a set of rolls, forgot to add one roll. It looks terrible and tastes so-so. Lots of rice, little fish. Well, at least, after complaining about the forgotten roll, they brought it + one as a gift and they looked better than the previous ones. To be honest, I am shocked that after so many years of popularity of sushi in Lviv, that someone manages to mess up like this. And miso soup is something with something, just a bowl of seaweed with a drop of liquid. Salad, not soup))) We talked to the manager of the establishment, who turned out to be very adequate. I hope she manages to build a better team of chefs for this establishment.

But judging by the ""disappointing"" reviews here and the restaurant's ""we're very concerned"" responses in recent months, it doesn't look like the Sushi Master chain is in a hurry to improve.","–ó–∞–º–æ–≤–ª—è–ª–∞, –±–æ –≤—ñ–¥–Ω–æ—Å–Ω–æ —à–≤–∏–¥–∫–µ –ø—Ä–∏–≥–æ—Ç—É–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—è —ñ –ø–æ—Ä—É—á –∑ –¥–æ–º–æ–º. –ù–∞–∂–∞–ª—å, —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–≤–∏ –≤–∑–∞–≥–∞–ª—ñ –Ω–µ —Å—Ö–æ–∂—ñ –¥–æ —Ç–∏—Ö —Ñ–æ—Ç–æ, —è–∫—ñ —î —É –Ω–∏—Ö –Ω–∞ —Å–∞–π—Ç—ñ. –ó–∞–º–æ–≤–ª—è–ª–∏ —Å–µ—Ç —Ä–æ–ª—ñ–≤, –æ–¥–∏–Ω —Ä–æ–ª –∑–∞–±—É–ª–∏ –¥–æ–¥–∞—Ç–∏. –í–∏–≥–ª—è–¥ –∂–∞—Ö–ª–∏–≤–∏–π —ñ —Å–º–∞–∫—É—î —Ç–∞–∫-—Å–æ–±—ñ. –ë–∞–≥–∞—Ç–æ —Ä–∏—Å—É, —Ä–∏–±–∏ –º–∞–ª–æ. –ù—É –ø—Ä–∏–Ω–∞–π–º–Ω—ñ, –ø—ñ—Å–ª—è —Å–∫–∞—Ä–≥–∏ –ø—Ä–æ –∑–∞–±—É—Ç–∏–π —Ä–æ–ª, –ø—Ä–∏–Ω–µ—Å–ª–∏ –π–æ–≥–æ + –æ–¥–∏–Ω –≤ –ø–æ–¥–∞—Ä—É–Ω–æ–∫ —ñ –≤–∏–≥–ª—è–¥–∞–ª–∏ –≤–æ–Ω–∏ –∫—Ä–∞—â–µ –ø–æ–ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥–Ω—ñ—Ö. –ß–µ—Å–Ω–æ –∫–∞–∂—É—á–∏, —è –≤ —à–æ—Ü—ñ, —à–æ –∑–∞ —Å—Ç—ñ–ª—å–∫–∏ —Ä–æ–∫—ñ–≤ –ø–æ–ø—É–ª—è—Ä–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—ñ —Å—É—à —É –õ—å–≤–æ–≤—ñ, —à–µ —Ö—Ç–æ—Å—å —É–º—É–¥—Ä—è—î—Ç—å—Å—è —Ç–∞–∫ –ª–∞–∂–∞—Ç–∏. –ê –º—ñ—Å–æ —Å—É–ø —Ü–µ —à–æ—Å—å –∑ —á–∏–º–æ—Å—å, –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ –º–∏—Å–∫–∞ –≤–æ–¥–æ—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–µ–π –∑ –∫—Ä–∞–ø–ª–∏–Ω–∫–æ—é —Ä—ñ–¥–∏–Ω–∏. –°–∞–ª–∞—Ç, –∞ –Ω–µ —Å—É–ø))) –°–ø—ñ–ª–∫—É–≤–∞–ª–∏—Å—è –∑ –º–µ–Ω–µ–¥–∂–µ—Ä–∫–æ—é –∑–∞–∫–ª–∞–¥—É, —è–∫–∞ –≤–∏—è–≤–∏–ª–∞—Å—å –¥—É–∂–µ –∞–¥–µ–∫–≤–∞—Ç–Ω–æ—é. –Ø —Å–ø–æ–¥—ñ–≤–∞—é—Å—è, —ó–π –≤–¥–∞—Å—Ç—å—Å—è –ø–æ–±—É–¥—É–≤–∞—Ç–∏ –∫—Ä–∞—â—É –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥—É –∫—É—Ö–∞—Ä—ñ–≤ –¥–ª—è —Ü—å–æ–≥–æ –∑–∞–∫–ª–∞–¥—É.

I was disappointed with the service for the second time in a week: again I did not receive my sushi on time, although I ordered delivery yesterday (today!!). And the same thing again: until I called the hotline, no one made or delivered my order. He called the hotline for two hours, and the hotline to the restaurant. As a result, I received the order that was supposed to be received at 7:00 p.m. almost at 9:30 p.m. Not only was it delivered almost 3 hours late, they also didn't bring the roll they gave me as compensation for the previous undelivered order.

We chose a table by the window with access to the courtyard, made an order, had a pleasant conversation with the waiter, and were impressed by the interior. It was quite cold in the hall, the air conditioner was working for heating, but probably not strong enough. We were brought drinks, no complaints, because we were informed about the composition, so ok, we chose ourselves, maybe just not for us (warm cocktail with sea buckthorn).
We ordered two salads, one with spicy and sweet chicken, the other Caesar with chicken, and were indignant because they turned out to be not tasty. That in one, that in the other, the chicken was stewed and very not tasty. In the first, the sauce was just the chicken in the sauce, in the second, everything was covered with sauce too much, which completely spoiled the taste. We left the salads, informed the waiter about it, he said that he would pass it on to the kitchen and come to us. We waited a very long time for an answer and did not wait, asked for the bill, during the payment the waiter told us that the chef said that everyone has their own tastes. On the unpleasant side, there was also the fact that next to our table there was a door where the guests of the establishment and the staff could go out for a smoke break, we could have warned, because it was already cold.

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Yesterday evening, I enjoyed dining at Mama Sushi at 74 Dyckman Street in upper Manhattan. This delightful eatery boasts three unique dining spaces to cater to your ambiance preference ‚Äì a cozy indoor area, a curbside space, and an innovative designated fenced area across the street. Since the weather was on my side, I settled comfortably in the latter, an arrangement showcasing Mama Sushi's creativity in urban space.

As the DJ effortlessly spun a selection of Latin tunes, my senses were entertained and enticed by their kitchen's exotic aroma. The well-chosen music and excellent audio quality added an extra layer of enjoyment to my dining experience, merging seamlessly with the restaurant's lively vibe.

Having had my fill of raw sushi in the past, I sought a different culinary adventure. The courteous and accommodating host pointed me towards their house sushi roll called 237 Dyckman - a delectable blend of Shrimp Tempura, Sweet Plantain, Avocado, and Cream Cheese, all coated in a sublime Eel Sauce and deep-fried to perfection. The sushi roll came with the usual sushi accompaniments and was generously portioned, adding value to the dining experience.

Although the wait was slightly longer than usual, it was understandable, given the bustling weekend crowd and the delightful weather. While the preparation and presentation were impressive, I still preferred the raw sushi variety.

The staff at Mama Sushi deserves a special mention. Despite the language barrier, some team members were not fluent in English, so they provided impeccable service. This place reflects the surrounding neighborhood, with Spanish as a common language.

One glance at their extensive menu shows that this restaurant is not just about sushi. Their vast offerings ensure I'll be back to embark on a new gastronomic journey. And the cherry on top? The roll dish and my soda cost were reasonable, promising quality food without breaking the bank.

Overall, my experience at Mama Sushi was overwhelmingly positive. It's an enchanting blend of delicious, inventive food, refreshing music, a unique ambiance, and welcoming staff. A gem in Manhattan that I'd highly recommend to locals and tourists alike.

Looking forward to my next visit, Mama Sushi! üç£","Title: A Sushi Haven with a Twist - Mama Sushi Delivers!

We tried the lobster and steak roll, eel avocado roll, and the mama sushi roll, and all of them were tasty. For appetizers, we had the dusted coconut shrimp, and it was simply delectable. The shrimp was perfectly cooked and coated with a light layer of coconut, which gave it a pleasant sweetness. It was served with a tangy dipping sauce that complemented the dish nicely.

To finish off our meal, we had the coconut flan, and it was the perfect way to end the meal. The flan was smooth and creamy, with a subtle coconut flavor that was not overpowering.

We have come. The waitress was friendly, no questions asked
Then they brought us a hot roll and carbonara, the roll was not fresh, not good and falling apart. Carbonara was not salty. It was extremely unpleasant. I am not scandalous, I asked to pay. They brought me a check, I leave the funds
The waiter takes them away
I'm waiting for the rest, it's not there, I get dressed, I stand waiting for me, there's no reaction, I approach the waiter to ask when the rest will be. She answers: the institution's administrator left or left on his own business, and only he has the right to calculate. I'm still waiting... it's not there. I decide to deposit without change (I exchange money with a person who was nearby) and leave the institution without any positive emotions. I understand, we are all people, we all have things to do, but when you go about your business from the workplace, you will ensure work without yourself.

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Yesterday evening, I enjoyed dining at Mama Sushi at 74 Dyckman Street in upper Manhattan. This delightful eatery boasts three unique dining spaces to cater to your ambiance preference ‚Äì a cozy indoor area, a curbside space, and an innovative designated fenced area across the street. Since the weather was on my side, I settled comfortably in the latter, an arrangement showcasing Mama Sushi's creativity in urban space.

As the DJ effortlessly spun a selection of Latin tunes, my senses were entertained and enticed by their kitchen's exotic aroma. The well-chosen music and excellent audio quality added an extra layer of enjoyment to my dining experience, merging seamlessly with the restaurant's lively vibe.

Having had my fill of raw sushi in the past, I sought a different culinary adventure. The courteous and accommodating host pointed me towards their house sushi roll called 237 Dyckman - a delectable blend of Shrimp Tempura, Sweet Plantain, Avocado, and Cream Cheese, all coated in a sublime Eel Sauce and deep-fried to perfection. The sushi roll came with the usual sushi accompaniments and was generously portioned, adding value to the dining experience.

Although the wait was slightly longer than usual, it was understandable, given the bustling weekend crowd and the delightful weather. While the preparation and presentation were impressive, I still preferred the raw sushi variety.

The staff at Mama Sushi deserves a special mention. Despite the language barrier, some team members were not fluent in English, so they provided impeccable service. This place reflects the surrounding neighborhood, with Spanish as a common language.

One glance at their extensive menu shows that this restaurant is not just about sushi. Their vast offerings ensure I'll be back to embark on a new gastronomic journey. And the cherry on top? The roll dish and my soda cost were reasonable, promising quality food without breaking the bank.

Overall, my experience at Mama Sushi was overwhelmingly positive. It's an enchanting blend of delicious, inventive food, refreshing music, a unique ambiance, and welcoming staff. A gem in Manhattan that I'd highly recommend to locals and tourists alike.

Black/African American customers beware. The lack of attention/ service for us here is appalling. I sat down at the bar  at the same  time as a Hispanic couple, I even gave up the seat I walked to so they could sit together. They were half complete with their beers before my order for a drink was even taken.
Everytime I needed something I had to flag down the bartender though I was sitting as the corner of the bar very visible. She continued to top off drinks, service with a smile  and take orders from everyone but me.
I was kind and had no obvious reason outside of my skin color not to help me. My drink sat empty for over 15 minutes while I sat silently and watched her serve others, joke with the other 2 bartenders and when her friends came in she was overjoyed and taking videos of them and immediately made them drinks before they went to their table.
She looked at me multiple times with an empty glass and half full plate and never once asked how I was doing.
If you do not visibly look like them or most definitely if you do not speak Spanish at this establishment you will not be treated equally. Save your time and money","The service is what ruins this place entirely.

Solyanka is almost the worst of all that I have tried (very rare, several pieces of sausage were floating in it, too rare), there were no olives in the soup, they were served with olives everywhere, the wings were served at the beginning soggy, they asked to redo it, they remade it, the waitress apologized well, tried to serve well. Potatoes taste normal. By the way, the buffalo wings are described as spicy, but not spicy at all. They asked to serve everything together, but they served it when they were ready, as a result the potatoes were cold until the wings arrived.
Nice place, interior, we will definitely come again and try other dishes.
But if all dishes are like this, then it‚Äôs understandable why there are very few people.

I don't like to write bad reviews, but this time I have to
It started with pre-ordering two positions by phone (they answered me as if I was not a customer and was asking for free food, the guy was showing how busy they were, and there was an incredible knocking because it was impossible to hear him the first time) but I missed it because everyone we humans all have our quirks
We have come. The waitress was friendly, no questions asked
Then they brought us a hot roll and carbonara, the roll was not fresh, not good and falling apart. Carbonara was not salty. It was extremely unpleasant. I am not scandalous, I asked to pay. They brought me a check, I leave the funds
The waiter takes them away
I'm waiting for the rest, it's not there, I get dressed, I stand waiting for me, there's no reaction, I approach the waiter to ask when the rest will be. She answers: the institution's administrator left or left on his own business, and only he has the right to calculate. I'm still waiting... it's not there. I decide to deposit without change (I exchange money with a person who was nearby) and leave the institution without any positive emotions. I understand, we are all people, we all have things to do, but when you go about your business from the workplace, you will ensure work without yourself.

To dine in this place we were waiting outside for half hour to get sited. Initially we were taking to the room downstairs and were surprised as several tables were unoccupied. The question is: why they didn't invite us to sit sooner but left us waiting outside on the cold?
The basement hall had no internet connection and less nice than the main one, so we asked to be moved as some people left. That was ok. We were permitted to stay on the main room.
We ordered for 4 people. First arrived one dish for one of us, 30 minutes later arrived another one and 30 minutes after that arrived other two. They were simple dishes. Why should we have waited for an hour??? We probably were forgotten.
The 'pork meat Gutsul stile' was nice as well as 'oven baked vegetables with cheese' but the 'oven baked chicken potatoes under chees' was rubbish.
Overal experience: tried it once. It was okeish but wouldn't come back.

This establishment is a cafe, not a restaurant like it was on Stryyska, so the dishes here are somewhat simpler, although there are also classics on the menu, such as deruna or forshmak, and complex dinners are on the menu.

We received the order at 7:30, we began to suspect that the vegetables for the borscht were grown during the cooking process, the borscht was not bad, we were lucky, the banosh turned out to be semolina porridge, with lumps (!!!), the puree was made from one potato, apparently she was also grown, because we received this miracle, at about 7:40.

Must mention their professional and artistic barista Sukhrob, who can teach you how to make your own perfect coffee or cocktail.
WA Lviv using is high quality products and their menu has mostly healthy options.
You will get glass of water without asking for it, which is not common for Ukraine, so you can understand the level of service here.
There is a charging station, sockets for your laptop or just to charge your phone around each table.
Interior design is something that you would notice the moment you enter. Every once in a while they are hosting special exhibition of modern art, which is so cool!
You might also enjoy their awesome playlist.

FYI I went to the Kyiv main restaurant and the silly requirements such as eating all of the rice and lettuce was not required. I ate 1 kg of meat on the grill without requesting the lettuce or other condiments. Only meat and rice.

Service is great though.

I wouldn't call this an authentic Korean BBQ place. Probably the best in terms of Asian cuisine places in Ukraine, but then again any ethnic food from Asia or any other continent other than Europe are quite lacking here, but still pretty low in terms of flavor and authenticity.

The babaganush is great, but it only comes in two tiny pies, so order more right away.
But the schnitzel, which this place is famous for, this time was completely disappointing, all the breading ""fell off"" from the meat, unfortunately I did not appreciate the potato salad, as it was dressed with a sauce with a noticeable amount of mustard and it interrupted the taste of the potatoes themselves.
Of course, sweets from the Candy Store are always good.
The waiters are very well trained, they know what to advise, but probably due to the fact that now during the renovation the Sugar Shop and the Restaurant are united in one room and there are more visitors from above, they are very busy, they have to wait a long time for a table, you have to wave your hand to attract attention, that's why this is also the nuance of the service, which I hope is temporary.
Of course, the atmosphere here is cozy, especially at the table near the window.","–†–µ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∞—Ü—ñ—è –Ω–∞–¥ —Ü—É–∫–µ—Ä–Ω–µ—é –∑–∞–≤–∂–¥–∏ –±—É–ª–∞ –≤–∏—à—É–∫–∞–Ω–∏–º –º—ñ—Å—Ü–µ–º, –∑ —É–≤–∞–∂–Ω–∏–º —Å–µ—Ä–≤—ñ—Å–æ–º —Ç–∞ —á—É–¥–æ–≤–æ—é –∫—É—Ö–Ω–µ—é, –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–µ –æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–Ω—ñ–π –≤—ñ–∑–∏—Ç —É –º–µ–Ω–µ –±—É–≤ –Ω–∞ 4-–∫—É.

Atmosphere, music, surroundings. A very nice girl, the waiter, offered me some prosecco and promised to feed me in 20 minutes. We were a family, the children were hungry. There were few guests, but the wait for the order was 40 minutes!!! The broth and fish soup are delicious and beautiful! The red mullet was ok, but the fried bulls were hopelessly spoiled. They were absolutely tasteless, and besides, they were deep-fried and not in a frying pan, as is customary in our country. Therefore, they had a lot of excess fat, and the breading was soggy; they were not crunchy at all.

I am not coming here for the first time, because there are not many establishments on Pasichnaya, so this is a great comfort for the whole district.
A simple cafe, without tricks, where, however, everything is very tasty.
I liked that the waitress advised what was better to try and could tell which of the dishes had the best taste.
We tried the roast beef with green butter, it was really cool! But the minus is 3 croutons to it, for such a portion you need to add at least one more.
Pumpkin soup was also delicious, thick, with nuts and bacon.
We also tried entrecote, tender meat and excellent mashed potatoes ""just like mom's"".

I add:
I consider this answer to the feedback incorrect
Why is the weight of each portion indicated in the menu? Is it possible that you do not pay attention to the quantity and weight when you order a product? Why do I have to pay extra for being underweight? You write like that about valuing work, I also work for the money that I use to pay for my orders

The idea is interesting, there is no concept. It is not clear where the entrance to the institution is, it seems like they wanted to make a riddle, but it turned out as if you ask us and we will tell you where the entrance is. The taste is not tasty at all, sweet, dry. This is an ordinary sponge cake and not Belgian chocolate at all. I am a confectioner and I can definitely tell where the chocolate is. This impression is as if ordinary chocolate ""crown"" or roshen was melted. I am generally silent about the chocolate in the middle, as if it were a simple chocolate filling from the supermarket. The choice of drinks is minimal. They offered to add chocolate in the middle of the bar, but they did not say that there would be an additional fee for this.
Drinks are generally a problem. Three types of juice, two types of teas, and those from a bag, not brewed. I can't say about coffee and alcoholic drinks because I don't drink them. The staff is not competent in what they offer, they cannot explain what the tea they offer tastes like. Not satisfied and do not recommend.","–í—ñ–¥–≤—ñ–¥–∞–ª–∞ –∑ –ø–æ–¥—Ä—É–≥–æ—é –≤—á–æ—Ä–∞ —Ü–µ–π –∑–∞–∫–ª–∞–¥. –Ü–¥–µ—è —Ü—ñ–∫–∞–≤–∞, –∫–æ–Ω—Ü–µ–ø—Ü—ñ—è –Ω—ñ—è–∫–∞. –í—Ö—ñ–¥ –≤ –∑–∞–∫–ª–∞–¥ –Ω–µ–∑—Ä–æ–∑—É–º—ñ–ª–æ –¥–µ, –≤—Ä–æ–¥—ñ —ñ —Ö–æ—Ç—ñ–ª–∏ –∑–∞–≥–∞–¥–∫—É –∑—Ä–æ–±–∏—Ç–∏ –∞–ª–µ –≤–∏–π—à–ª–æ –Ω—ñ–±–∏ –≤–∏ –Ω–∞—Å –∑–∞–ø–∏—Ç–∞–π—Ç–µ –∞ –º–∏ —Å–∫–∞–∂–µ–º–æ –¥–µ –≤—Ö—ñ–¥. –ù–∞ —Å–º–∞–∫ –≤–∑–∞–≥–∞–ª—ñ –Ω–µ —Å–º–∞—á–Ω–æ, —Å–æ–ª–æ–¥–∫–æ, —Å—É—Ö–æ. –¶–µ –∑–≤–∏—á–∞–π–Ω–∏–π –ø—ñ—Å–æ—á–Ω–∏–π –±—ñ—Å–∫–≤—ñ—Ç —ñ –Ω—ñ—è–∫–∏–π —Ç–æ –Ω–µ –±–µ–ª—å–≥—ñ–π—Å—å–∫–∏–π —à–æ–∫–æ–ª–∞–¥. –Ø –∫–æ–Ω–¥–∏—Ç–µ—Ä —ñ –≤–∂–µ —Ç–æ—á–Ω–æ –º–æ–∂—É —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç–∏ –¥–µ —è–∫–∏–π —à–æ–∫–æ–ª–∞–¥. –¢–∞–∫–µ –≤—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–Ω—è –Ω—ñ–±–∏ —Ä–æ–∑—Ç–æ–ø–∏–ª–∏ –∑–≤–∏—á–∞–π–Ω—É —à–æ–∫–æ–ª–∞–¥–∫—É ¬´–∫–æ—Ä–æ–Ω–∞¬ª —á–∏ —Ä–æ—à–µ–Ω.   –ü—Ä–æ —à–æ–∫–æ–ª–∞–¥ –≤ —Å–µ—Ä–µ–¥–∏–Ω—ñ –≤–∑–∞–≥–∞–ª—ñ –º–æ–≤—á—É, –Ω—ñ–±–∏ –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∏–π —à–æ–∫–æ–ª–∞–¥–Ω–∏–π –Ω–∞–ø–æ–≤–Ω—é–≤–∞—á –∑ —Å—É–ø–µ—Ä–º–∞—Ä–∫–µ—Ç—É. –í–∏–±—ñ—Ä –Ω–∞–ø–æ—ó–≤ –º—ñ–Ω—ñ–º–∞–ª—å–Ω–∏–π. –ó–∞–ø—Ä–æ–ø–æ–Ω—É–≤–∞–ª–∏ –¥–æ–ø–æ–≤–Ω–∏—Ç–∏ –ø—Ä—É—Ç–µ–Ω—å –≤ —Å–µ—Ä–µ–¥–∏–Ω—ñ —à–æ–∫–æ–ª–∞–¥–æ–º –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–µ –Ω–µ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª–∏ —â–æ –∑–∞ —Ü–µ –¥–æ–¥–∞—Ç–∫–æ–≤–∞ –ø–ª–∞—Ç–∞.

It's delicious, everything is fine, the choice is nice, but they still haven't chosen the one that's definitely delicious.
There are several salads in the assortment,
Salad with veal tongue and beetroot mousse (4/5) - delicious.
Today we decided to order ""Salad with camembert cheese and honey mustard dressing"" (5/5), extremely tasty.
We also tried today ""Tempura chicken (cheese sauce)"" (3/5), it seemed greasy, at least it would not be superfluous to soak it a little with a napkin before serving (

I fully understand that it is a weekend, and the number of guests may be higher, so why not put more staff on shift?
We ordered 3 beers, 2 pizzas and 1 portion of antipasti.
In a few minutes they brought beer, after 15 minutes pizza, after another 5 we were served a table, but the antipasti was never brought, although we were counting on it before the pizza.
After some time, the administrator came to clear the table, we clarified how long we would have to wait for the antipasti, what was the answer, whether we had ordered it at all and how long ago.
It was clear that the waitress had simply forgotten to punch in our order completely.
Having spent another good 10 minutes waiting, I had to refuse the meal, because the cut, which is prepared at 100% occupancy of the establishment, takes up to 15 minutes, but no more.","–î—É–∂–µ —à–∫–æ–¥–∞, —â–æ —Ç–∞–∫–∏–π –Ω–∏–∑—å–∫–∏–π —Ä—ñ–≤–µ–Ω—å –æ–±—Å–ª—É–≥–æ–≤—É–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—è.

But we are stubborn people, so after looking around we still found him. We recommend that owners install additional billboards or adjust location information. Everything about the interior is very decent: nice, clean, design in modern motifs. The waiter is polite, took the order quickly, navigated the menu, served the dishes on time. I can't say that the menu is big, there aren't many dishes. We chose broth for the first course, and pork steak with potatoes and veal medallions with mushroom sauce for the second course. Everything was tasty, the meat was cooked well, the design of the dish could have looked more restaurant-like, but it did not affect the taste in any way.

We lived in the complex where the institution is located, so we went there many times. Both for breakfast and dinner, in addition, the establishment serves by the pool when it's warm. I don't like oysters (a feature of the establishment), so I didn't taste them, but my friend said they were very fresh and tasty.

I witnessed how the waiter or the cook poured the dishes into those large containers, which were on the counter and at the foot of the table, where the salad was spilled, and then also the potatoes. I made a remark that all the food was lying on the tables, and the waiter picked it all up with his hand and threw it to the rest of the food! That is, in front of my eyes, he picked up the food that fell on the dirty table at his feet and threw it into the container from where customers collect their meals! It's just horrible. If they allow themselves to do this in front of a client, then it means that it is the norm for them, and in the kitchen, probably even more trash is made!

We chose a table by the window with access to the courtyard, made an order, had a pleasant conversation with the waiter, and were impressed by the interior. It was quite cold in the hall, the air conditioner was working for heating, but probably not strong enough. We were brought drinks, no complaints, because we were informed about the composition, so ok, we chose ourselves, maybe just not for us (warm cocktail with sea buckthorn).
We ordered two salads, one with spicy and sweet chicken, the other Caesar with chicken, and were indignant because they turned out to be not tasty. That in one, that in the other, the chicken was stewed and very not tasty. In the first, the sauce was just the chicken in the sauce, in the second, everything was covered with sauce too much, which completely spoiled the taste. We left the salads, informed the waiter about it, he said that he would pass it on to the kitchen and come to us. We waited a very long time for an answer and did not wait, asked for the bill, during the payment the waiter told us that the chef said that everyone has their own tastes. On the unpleasant side, there was also the fact that next to our table there was a door where the guests of the establishment and the staff could go out for a smoke break, we could have warned, because it was already cold. The bartender, who was wearing a hood all the time and after a smoke break, started preparing drinks without washing his hands. They were not satisfied as much as possible, there is no desire to come again.

To dine in this place we were waiting outside for half hour to get sited. Initially we were taking to the room downstairs and were surprised as several tables were unoccupied. The question is: why they didn't invite us to sit sooner but left us waiting outside on the cold?
The basement hall had no internet connection and less nice than the main one, so we asked to be moved as some people left. That was ok. We were permitted to stay on the main room.
We ordered for 4 people. First arrived one dish for one of us, 30 minutes later arrived another one and 30 minutes after that arrived other two. They were simple dishes. Why should we have waited for an hour??? We probably were forgotten.
The 'pork meat Gutsul stile' was nice as well as 'oven baked vegetables with cheese' but the 'oven baked chicken potatoes under chees' was rubbish.
Overal experience: tried it once. It was okeish but wouldn't come back.
Service and food were very average as well as the price.","Lovely restaurant with lovely interior design and atmosphere. There was a live music as well which was a nice compliment.
To dine in this place we were waiting outside for half hour to get sited. Initially we were taking to the room downstairs and were surprised as several tables were unoccupied. The question is: why they didn't invite us to sit sooner but left us waiting outside on the cold?
The basement hall had no internet connection and less nice than the main one, so we asked to be moved as some people left. That was ok. We were permitted to stay on the main room.
We ordered for 4 people. First arrived one dish for one of us, 30 minutes later arrived another one and 30 minutes after that arrived other two. They were simple dishes. Why should we have waited for an hour??? We probably were forgotten.
The 'pork meat Gutsul stile' was nice as well as 'oven baked vegetables with cheese' but the 'oven baked chicken potatoes under chees' was rubbish.

Service is great though.

I wouldn't call this an authentic Korean BBQ place. Probably the best in terms of Asian cuisine places in Ukraine, but then again any ethnic food from Asia or any other continent other than Europe are quite lacking here, but still pretty low in terms of flavor and authenticity.

The babaganush is great, but it only comes in two tiny pies, so order more right away.
But the schnitzel, which this place is famous for, this time was completely disappointing, all the breading ""fell off"" from the meat, unfortunately I did not appreciate the potato salad, as it was dressed with a sauce with a noticeable amount of mustard and it interrupted the taste of the potatoes themselves.
Of course, sweets from the Candy Store are always good.
The waiters are very well trained, they know what to advise, but probably due to the fact that now during the renovation the Sugar Shop and the Restaurant are united in one room and there are more visitors from above, they are very busy, they have to wait a long time for a table, you have to wave your hand to attract attention, that's why this is also the nuance of the service, which I hope is temporary.

They were absolutely tasteless, and besides, they were deep-fried and not in a frying pan, as is customary in our country.

We tried the roast beef with green butter, it was really cool! But the minus is 3 croutons to it, for such a portion you need to add at least one more.
Pumpkin soup was also delicious, thick, with nuts and bacon.

The idea is interesting, there is no concept. It is not clear where the entrance to the institution is, it seems like they wanted to make a riddle, but it turned out as if you ask us and we will tell you where the entrance is. The taste is not tasty at all, sweet, dry. This is an ordinary sponge cake and not Belgian chocolate at all. I am a confectioner and I can definitely tell where the chocolate is. This impression is as if ordinary chocolate ""crown"" or roshen was melted. I am generally silent about the chocolate in the middle, as if it were a simple chocolate filling from the supermarket. The choice of drinks is minimal. They offered to add chocolate in the middle of the bar, but they did not say that there would be an additional fee for this.
Drinks are generally a problem. Three types of juice, two types of teas, and those from a bag, not brewed. I can't say about coffee and alcoholic drinks because I don't drink them. The staff is not competent in what they offer, they cannot explain what the tea they offer tastes like.

Pizza Caesarini (4/5), today we tasted ""Korida"" (4/5).
It's delicious, everything is fine, the choice is nice, but they still haven't chosen the one that's definitely delicious.
There are several salads in the assortment,
Salad with veal tongue and beetroot mousse (4/5) - delicious.
Today we decided to order ""Salad with camembert cheese and honey mustard dressing"" (5/5), extremely tasty.
We also tried today ""Tempura chicken (cheese sauce)"" (3/5), it seemed greasy, at least it would not be superfluous to soak it a little with a napkin before serving (
Drinks - whatever they cost - everything was delicious. The assortment is very large and it seems to me that everything is delicious.

After some time, the administrator came to clear the table, we clarified how long we would have to wait for the antipasti, what was the answer, whether we had ordered it at all and how long ago.
It was clear that the waitress had simply forgotten to punch in our order completely.

But we are stubborn people, so after looking around we still found him. We recommend that owners install additional billboards or adjust location information. Everything about the interior is very decent: nice, clean, design in modern motifs. The waiter is polite, took the order quickly, navigated the menu, served the dishes on time. I can't say that the menu is big, there aren't many dishes. We chose broth for the first course, and pork steak with potatoes and veal medallions with mushroom sauce for the second course. Everything was tasty, the meat was cooked well, the design of the dish could have looked more restaurant-like, but it did not affect the taste in any way. Prices are standard, as for this type of establishment.

We lived in the complex where the institution is located, so we went there many times. Both for breakfast and dinner, in addition, the establishment serves by the pool when it's warm. I don't like oysters (a feature of the establishment), so I didn't taste them, but my friend said they were very fresh and tasty.

They had a violinist and accordion players come to our table. Prices were about normal for Lviv. Good staff. Outlets at each table for charging phones. The menu is in English as well.

But.  The food took a looong time and they weren't busy. The mackerel tasted wrong. The waiter said that's how it should taste but my girl couldn't eat it so we ordered another plate of potato pancakes. They were pretty good but the first order was cooked different, so obviously the chef isn't paying close attention tonight. My trout tasted good.

I probably won't come back, but overall my experience was ok.","Came here with my girl Friday at 19:00. Nice atmosphere. They had a violinist and accordion players come to our table.

We chose a table by the window with access to the courtyard, made an order, had a pleasant conversation with the waiter, and were impressed by the interior. It was quite cold in the hall, the air conditioner was working for heating, but probably not strong enough. We were brought drinks, no complaints, because we were informed about the composition, so ok, we chose ourselves, maybe just not for us (warm cocktail with sea buckthorn).
We ordered two salads, one with spicy and sweet chicken, the other Caesar with chicken, and were indignant because they turned out to be not tasty. That in one, that in the other, the chicken was stewed and very not tasty. In the first, the sauce was just the chicken in the sauce, in the second, everything was covered with sauce too much, which completely spoiled the taste. We left the salads, informed the waiter about it, he said that he would pass it on to the kitchen and come to us. We waited a very long time for an answer and did not wait, asked for the bill, during the payment the waiter told us that the chef said that everyone has their own tastes. On the unpleasant side, there was also the fact that next to our table there was a door where the guests of the establishment and the staff could go out for a smoke break, we could have warned, because it was already cold. The bartender, who was wearing a hood all the time and after a smoke break, started preparing drinks without washing his hands. They were not satisfied as much as possible, there is no desire to come again.

We came on Sunday, the hall was not full, but the lady who took the order said that the waiting time for the dishes was 30-35 minutes. It's strange, but okay, we came specifically to see you. We witnessed how people at the next table asked why the waiting time was so long, the lady explained that there is still delivery and the dishes are prepared on the spot. So, 40 minutes have passed, cold mashed potatoes are brought to me. In fact, you say?)) I say that the puree is cold, the lady takes my dish with the words ""I only bring food"" and disappears. I wait a few minutes and go down to ask what happened to my mashed potatoes. I hear ""we are processing"")) after another 10 minutes after waiting for dishes for 40 minutes, they bring me the same heated puree. The turkey patties became very dry, or I was lucky twice today.
Dumplings with cherries were brought 55 minutes after ordering, the cherry is as sour as possible.
I understand that there are different situations, but unfortunately, it is not very pleasant.
Do you have cool dishes, a cool selection? will solve the problem with anticipation, because there is not always so much time to sit.","–ù–µ –∑–Ω–∞—é, —â–æ —Å—Ç–∞–ª–æ—Å—å, –∞–ª–µ –∑–∞–∫–ª–∞–¥, —è–∫–∏–π —è —Ä–∞–Ω—ñ—à–µ –¥—É–∂–µ –ª—é–±–∏–ª–∞, –Ω–µ–æ—á—ñ–∫—É–≤–∞–Ω–æ –∑—ñ–ø—Å—É–≤–∞–≤—Å—è. –ú–∏ –ø—Ä–∏–π—à–ª–∏ –≤ –Ω–µ–¥—ñ–ª—é, –∑–∞–ª –Ω–µ –∑–∞–ø–æ–≤–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–π, –∞–ª–µ –ø–∞–Ω—ñ, —è–∫–∞ –ø—Ä–∏–π–º–∞–ª–∞ –∑–∞–º–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—è, —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª–∞, —â–æ —á–∞—Å –æ—á—ñ–∫—É–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—è —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–≤ 30-35 —Ö–≤. –î–∏–≤–Ω–æ, –Ω—É –∞–ª–µ –æ–∫–µ–π, –º–∏ —ó—Ö–∞–ª–∏ —Å–ø–µ—Ü—ñ–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ –¥–æ –≤–∞—Å. –ú–∏ —Å—Ç–∞–ª–∏ —Å–≤—ñ–¥–∫–∞–º–∏, —è–∫ –ª—é–¥–∏ –∑–∞ —Å—É—Å—ñ–¥–Ω—ñ–º —Å—Ç–æ–ª–∏–∫–æ–º –ø–∏—Ç–∞–ª–∏, —á–æ–º—É —Ç–∞–∫–∏–π —Ç—Ä–∏–≤–∞–ª–∏–π —á–∞—Å –æ—á—ñ–∫—É–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—è, –ø–∞–Ω—ñ –ø–æ—è—Å–Ω—é–≤–∞–ª–∞, —â–æ —î —â–µ –¥–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∞ —ñ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–≤–∏ –≥–æ—Ç—É—é—Ç—å—Å—è –ø–æ —Ñ–∞–∫—Ç—É. –û—Ç–∂–µ, –ø—Ä–æ–π—à–ª–æ 40 —Ö–≤–∏–ª–∏–Ω, –º–µ–Ω—ñ –ø—Ä–∏–Ω–æ—Å—è—Ç—å —Ö–æ–ª–æ–¥–Ω–µ –ø—é—Ä–µ. –ü–æ —Ñ–∞–∫—Ç—É, –∫–∞–∂–µ—Ç–µ?)) —è –∫–∞–∂—É, —â–æ –ø—é—Ä–µ —Ö–æ–ª–æ–¥–Ω–µ, –ø–∞–Ω—ñ –∑–∞–±–∏—Ä–∞—î –º–æ—é —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–≤—É –∑—ñ —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞–º–∏ ¬´—è –ª–∏—à–µ –ø—Ä–∏–Ω–æ—à—É —ó–∂—É¬ª —ñ –ø—Ä–æ–ø–∞–¥–∞—î. –Ø —á–µ–∫–∞—é –¥–µ–∫—ñ–ª—å–∫–∞ —Ö–≤–∏–ª–∏–Ω —ñ —Å–ø—É—Å–∫–∞—é—Å—å —Å–ø–∏—Ç–∞—Ç–∏, —è–∫–∞ —Å—É–¥—å–±–∞ –≤ –º–æ–≥–æ –∫–∞—Ä—Ç–æ–ø–ª—è–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø—é—Ä–µ. –ß—É—é ¬´–ø–µ—Ä–µ—Ä–æ–±–ª—è—î–º–æ¬ª)) —â–µ —á–µ—Ä–µ–∑ 10 —Ö–≤–∏–ª–∏–Ω –ø—ñ—Å–ª—è –æ—á—ñ–∫—É–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—è —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–≤ –≤ 40 —Ö–≤–∏–ª–∏–Ω, –º–µ–Ω—ñ –ø—Ä–∏–Ω–æ—Å—è—Ç—å —Ç–µ —Å–∞–º–µ —Ä–æ–∑—ñ–≥—Ä—ñ—Ç–µ –ø—é—Ä–µ. –ö–æ—Ç–ª–µ—Ç–∏ –∑ —ñ–Ω–¥–∏—á–∫–∏ —Å—Ç–∞–ª–∏ –¥—É–∂–µ —Å—É—Ö—ñ, –∞–±–æ –º–µ–Ω—ñ —Ç–∞–∫ –¥–≤—ñ—á—ñ —Å—å–æ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—ñ –ø–æ—â–∞—Å—Ç–∏–ª–æ.
